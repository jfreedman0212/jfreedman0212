# Hey ðŸ‘‹

My name's Josh and I like computers!

Most of my repos/contributions fit into one of the following categories:

- Things I did in university that haven't been touched since
- Servers I run for personal shenanigans (web server for my blog, Minecraft servers, etc.)
- Random little experiments I tinker with for a little bit, then stop

In other words: nothing useful, really. Just a collection of things I find neat ðŸ˜„.
